### Project Details

 #### *Background*

> This is a **supervised learning algorithm** which means that it "relies on labeled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new unlabeled data."

We chose this model because:


#### **Our Goal**:

> **Pitch**: Build an app to enable users to browse and visualize audio features of over 116k spotify songs.

MVP: User can search for a specific song and see its audio features displayed in a visually appealing way. The app also identifies songs with similar audio features.
DS:
1. Build a model to recommend songs based on similarity to user input (I like song x, here are n songs like it based on these similar features)
2. Create visualizations using song data to highlight similarities and differences between recommendations.
